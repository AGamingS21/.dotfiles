# TODO:
- Get list of software
- how to source control vs code config?
    - Profiles:
        - Using globalStorage/storage.json in the userDataProfiles property all the profiles can be set and view the json files in the profiles folder.
        - Maybe cron script or a make file to add the profile into the storage.json file when running make or even periodically?
