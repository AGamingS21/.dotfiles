- how to source control vs code config?
    - Profiles:
        - profiles sync script steps:
            - make sure profile folder name and location is added to storage.json
            - move any keyboard shortcuts, settings, etc to each profile folder
            - run loop through config file and install each extension extension to each profile
            - Find a way to run the script that will syncronize copy and keyboard shortcuts, settings, etc back to profiles config folder
            - run a sync for copying any extensions to the profile config
            - possibly use the settings.json with Custom Command for running the repo sync everytime it is loaded.
            
    - Keyboard Shortcuts
        - Find some of the ones I have at work and add those here.
    - Extensions:
        - need to run --install from extension file
